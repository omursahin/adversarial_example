More information will be added in the upcoming days.
## Installation
Python 3.10 is required to run the code. The required packages can be installed using the following commands:

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

Generate the adversarial attacks using the following command:

```python ./main.py```

Modify the configuration file to change the parameters of the algorithm. The configuration file is located at [./core/helper/conf.ini](core/helper/conf.ini).
